# ESO-help

2019-09-15 this is half-finished as a tech demo I might work on it.  I can probably make TES: Skyrim one into a mobile web application.  Lots of changes were implemented into The Elder Scrolls Online mostly UI also the "Jewelcrafting" Profession.  I WAS THERE *BRAIN* *STORM*.

Basically what this one does it organizes the Nightblade spells as a permutative buff selection tool with an eye towards the more optional Abilities Fighter's Guild, Mage's Guild, Werewolf, Vampire.  What's the solution in-game, learn all the different Abilities!  There was a corresponding change made in-game regarding respec costs I don't rememeber the details.
